# AI-Jarvis-Using-Python-Project
**Project Description: Jarvis AI Assistant**

**Overview:**
Jarvis AI Assistant is an intelligent virtual assistant powered by cutting-edge AI and natural language processing technologies. Inspired by Tony Stark's AI assistant from the Marvel universe, Jarvis aims to assist users in various tasks, provide quick answers to questions, and perform web automation seamlessly.

**Key Features:**
1. **Voice Recognition:** Jarvis can understand and process voice commands using the SpeechRecognition library, allowing users to interact with the assistant through speech.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Leveraging NLTK, the assistant can comprehend and interpret natural language queries, making conversations with Jarvis feel more human-like.

3. **AI Brain and Q&A:** Jarvis employs OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to provide smart responses to user queries, answering questions and engaging in meaningful conversations.

4. **Web Automation:** Using Selenium and PyAutoGUI, Jarvis can perform web automation tasks, such as opening websites, executing searches, and even controlling Windows applications.

5. **Language Translation:** Jarvis can translate text from Bengali (bn) to English (en) using the Translate library, breaking language barriers and assisting multilingual users.

6. **Task Execution:** The AI brain of Jarvis can be trained to execute various predefined tasks, such as launching applications, performing specific actions, and responding to custom commands.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- OpenAI GPT-3.5
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Selenium
- PyAutoGUI
- SpeechRecognition
- Translate
